## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
This is a simple GUI wrapper for a few basic command line tools. So far, the appearance and general functionality of this program is very simple, although it will be touched up on in future updates. Eventually, I will be building a bigger, more complex version of this application, and will be selling it with far more tools and additional functionality.

## üíæ Installation

### üì¶ Prerequisites 
You will need the following installed on your device in order to run this application:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Pip (should come installed with Python)

Ensure you have Python installed by running this command in your terminal: `python --version`
You should see the version of Python you have installed in the output.

### üóÇ Clone repository

Clone this repository by running the command below in the directory you‚Äôd like this application saved to.

Once you have the files on your local machine, install the necessary dependencies by running the command below:

Finally, you can run the application using `python3 Multi-tool-GUI.py`!
